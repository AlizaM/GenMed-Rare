# GenMed-Rare

A PyTorch-based computer-vision project that focuses on improving medical image classification by synthesizing rare cases with generative models. The repository provides a reproducible skeleton and experiment protocol to compare classification performance with and without generated data.

## Project goal (short)

Improve classification performance on rare medical cases by augmenting training sets with synthetic images generated by generative models (e.g. GANs, diffusion models). Compare classifier performance across different amounts of synthetic data and report statistical results.

## High-level design / components

- Data: curated medical images placed under `data/raw/` and preprocessed into `data/processed/`.
- Generative models: implementations live in `src/models/` (e.g., `gan.py`, `diffusion.py`).
- Classifiers: standard backbones and medical-specific architectures under `src/models/classifiers/`.
- Training code: training and evaluation utilities under `src/train/`.
- Experiments: `scripts/` contains entry points to run generation, classifier training, and evaluation. `experiments/` stores experiment configs and notes.
- Outputs: model checkpoints and generated samples under `outputs/`.

## Repository layout

- `data/` - raw and processed datasets
  - `data/raw/` - raw/unmodified data
  - `data/processed/` - preprocessed data ready for training
- `notebooks/` - exploratory notebooks and small demos
- `src/` - source code
  - `src/models/` - model definitions (generative + classifiers)
  - `src/data/` - dataset wrappers and dataloaders
  - `src/train/` - training loops, schedulers, and CLI entrypoints
  - `src/utils/` - utilities (metrics, logging, visualization)
- `configs/` - YAML/JSON configuration files (one per experiment)
- `scripts/` - helper scripts (generate, train classifier, evaluate, aggregate)
- `experiments/` - experiment-specific folders and logs
- `outputs/` - training outputs
  - `outputs/checkpoints/` - saved model checkpoints
  - `outputs/samples/` - generated samples during training
- `tests/` - unit/integration tests
- `docs/` - documentation and design notes


## Quick start (repeat)

1. Create a Python virtual environment:

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
